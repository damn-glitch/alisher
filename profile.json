      "description": "Bioremediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated environments using native microorganisms is a promising strategy for addressing oil pollution in Kazakhstan’s oil-producing areas. This study evaluated the hydrocarbon-oxidizing activity of a Bacillus subtilis strain. Twenty-three isolates were obtained by enrichment culture from oil-saturated soils at the Zhetibai field in the Mangystau region. Cultural, morphological, and biochemical tests following Bergey’s Manual confirmed the identity of the chosen strain as B. subtilis.Its ability to use crude oil and diesel fuel as sole carbon sources was tested in liquid Luria–Bertani medium supplemented with either Zhetibai crude oil or commercial diesel (C₁₃–C₁₈ hydrocarbons, boiling range 200–330 °C). Cultures were incubated aerobically at pH 6.5–7.0, 200 rpm, for 96 hours. Growth was monitored turbidimetrically by measuring optical density at 600 nm to quantify biomass accumulation and substrate utilization. This 96-hour experiment provided detailed insights into growth kinetics and substrate preferences under controlled laboratory conditions.Results showed robust growth of B. subtilis in both media, confirming its biodegradation potential. Diesel-supplemented cultures exhibited a shorter lag phase and higher peak optical density than crude oil cultures, indicating that diesel components are more readily assimilated. These observations reflect differences in hydrocarbon chain length and structure that influence microbial uptake and metabolism.Overall, indigenous B. subtilis strains demonstrate significant potential for degrading petroleum hydrocarbons in contaminated soils. Incorporating these organisms into a tailored microbial consortium could enhance pollutant-removal efficiency. Bioremediation using native bacteria offers an eco-friendly, biologically safe complement to mechanical and chemical cleanup methods, reducing residual contamination while preserving the ecological balance of affected regions."

      "publication_link": null,
      "publication_date": null,
      "description": "In this project, we have developed an intelligent system that takes a single document and classifies different writing styles within the document using stylometric analysis. The classification is done using K-Means Clustering (an unsupervised machine learning method). First, the document is divided into chunks of text using a standard chunk size. Then, for each chunk of text, a vector of stylometric features is computed. After that, the chunks are clustered using their vectors of stylometric features. This is where unsupervised machine learning comes into play. The chunks with the same style are clustered together, and the number of clusters made corresponds to the number of different writing styles that the document has. In this approach, the value of K is determined using the Elbow Method. We also ran an experiment for a document with two writing styles, and our system successfully identified that the document had two different writing styles. Our approach separates out text with the same style from that of different styles and can be used to detect plagiarism as well."
